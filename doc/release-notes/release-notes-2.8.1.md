Release Notes v2.8.1
====================

This release introduces worker-based updates for expensive submission state
computation. It offloads work from the main web loop when processing
incoming messages so responses are quicker.

When deploying to production, make sure to size both instances and worker
concurrency so that, you don't use up all available compute cores and not
use enough making updates very slow.
